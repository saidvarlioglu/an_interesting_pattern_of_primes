# Patterns of Prime Numbers based on Symmetrical Distributions
The prime numbers hold many mysteries for mathematicians and computer engineers.

I used Ulman's spiral (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) and changed it with a space in the core (10^2 square as seen in the excel file).

This pattern may help mathematicians and computer engineers to improve information security architectures.
